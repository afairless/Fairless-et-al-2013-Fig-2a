The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
empirical data used in Fairless et al 2011.
I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
NOTE:  Because the data have been altered, many characteristics of the original 
data set will not be retained.
